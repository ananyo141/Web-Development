        <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>

        <p> This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page.
        And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>

        <h2>This is a sub-heading</h2>

        <p> Many long articles have sub-headings to help you follow the structure of what is being written. 
        There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level-headings).</p>

        <h2> Another sub-heading</h2>

        <p> Hope you can see another <b>sub-heading.</b></p>

        <p> A <b>paragraph</b> consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of 
            a paragraph is indicated by a newline.</p>

        <p> <i>Test</i> is easier to understand when it is split up into units of 
            test. For example, a book may have chapters, chapters can have subheadings. Under paragraphs.</p>

        <h1> The story in the Book </h1>
        <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
        <p> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other
            scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she
            spent in those four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>

        <p> She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better
            to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the Llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding acievement, Molly <em>did</em>
            think she had something better to do.

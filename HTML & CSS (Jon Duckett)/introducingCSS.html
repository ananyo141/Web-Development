        <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
        <p>A <i>potager</i> is a <em>French</em> term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often
            flowers(edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance
            the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically
            pleasing.
        </p>

        <h2>What to Plant</h2>
        <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Many are trained
            to grow upward. A well-designer potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with
            very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their functions of providing for a home in a wide
            array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.
        </p>

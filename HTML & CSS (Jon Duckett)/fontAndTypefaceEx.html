        <h3>A heart wrapped in fur</h3>

        <p class="definition">The <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/briard" class="definition" target="_blank">briard</a>, or <span class="italic">berger de brie</span>, is a large breed of dog 
            traditionally used as a herder and
            guardian of sheep.</p>

        <h2>Breed History</h2>
        <p class="intro">The <dfn>briard</dfn>, which is believed to have 
            originated in France, has been bred for centuries
            to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to
            search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the 
            First World War almost to the point of extiction. Currently the population of briards is slowly
            recovering. <span class="italic">Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette</span> all owned briards.</p>

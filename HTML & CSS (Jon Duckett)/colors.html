            <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
            <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from
                Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important
                components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved
                gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in
                their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.

            <h2>Newest and Most Recent addition to CSS</h2>
            <p>This section is dedicated the the newest addition to the CSS system which let's the
                designed get more control over the presentation of the content by adding hue, saturation
                and lightning controls. Also, now the opacity or 'alpha' value can be changed to make
                the element more transparent or opaque.

        <p>The first step toward successful bird identification is knowing the basic parts of a bird. Thrushes have the most
        common, classic bird "shape" that is easily broken into all the key parts, each of which can be examined closely to help
        identify birds.
        
        Head: The bird's head is one of the best places to look for field marks such as eye color, malar stripes, eyebrows, eye
        rings, eye lines, and auricular patches. The crown (top) and nape (back) are also key parts of the head that can help
        identify a bird.</p>
